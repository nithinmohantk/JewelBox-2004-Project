# JewelBox-2004-Project

**About**

JewelBox 2004 was an untimate Jewellery Shop Management system conceptualized for MCA - Mid Term - Project work as part of the curriculam. 

Later as part of my learning in programming, I have enhanced it further with new features. That was the time when Microsft has release .NET Framework 1.0 along with Visual Studio .Net 2002, the first .NET IDE. Since .NET Framework was fancy enough to capture my attention, I have ported the solution in to VB.NET and C#, and later migrated to MYSQL and VS2005 etc. 

## Technology Stack
### For older version:
1. Visual Basic 6.0 
2. Microsoft Access 

### .NET Port
1. .NET Framework 1.1 or .NET Framework 2.0
2. Visual Studio .NET 2003 or Visual Studio 2005 
2. MySQL 5.0 to later with ODBC
